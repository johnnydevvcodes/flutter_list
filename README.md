**Project Summary: Flutter List Application**
This project involved creating a Flutter mobile application that interacts with a backend GET endpoint to retrieve a list of users, removes duplicates, and displays the unique user list. Users can tap on individual entries to view detailed user information. Key objectives included implementing MVVM, SOLID, and CLEAN design principles while providing unit testing for non-UI classes.

**Retrieve User List:** Implemented functionality to fetch user data from the specified backend endpoint.

**Remove Duplicates:** Developed a mechanism to eliminate duplicate user entries.

**Display User List:** Designed a user interface for scrolling through the unique user list.

**User Details Screen:** Enabled user interaction to view detailed user information.

**Design Principles:** Implemented MVVM, SOLID, and CLEAN design principles for code maintainability and organization.

**Unit Testing:** Created unit tests to ensure the functionality of non-UI classes.

The project is hosted in a public Git repository for further review.
